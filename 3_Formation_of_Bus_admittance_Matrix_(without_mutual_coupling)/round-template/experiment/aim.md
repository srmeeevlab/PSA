#### The aim of the experiment is to form the bus admittance using direct inspection method.
#### At the end of the experiment the student will able to,
1.	Determine the self-admittance of the Ybus matrix for the given power system network.
2.	Determine the mutual-admittance of the Ybus matrix for the given power system network.
3.	Formation of bus admittance matrix (Ybus) for power system studies.
