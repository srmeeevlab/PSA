#### The aim of the experiment is to determine the power flow analysis using Gauss Seidel method. 
#### The main objective of the experiments is completely understanding the,
1.	Set of non- linear algebraic equations using Gauss-seidel power flow algorithm
2.	Calculation of unknown quantities of Generator and load bus for a given Power System network.
3.	Calculation of Slack bus power and transmission line loss in the given Power System network.
