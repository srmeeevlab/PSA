### INTRODUCTION<br>
#### In reactance diagram, the components are represented by its reactance value and it is the simplified equivalent circuit of power system. The reactance diagram can be framed using the impedance diagram by neglecting all resistive components [2].

### CONCEPT<br>
#### This experiment mainly focuses on how to draw the reactance diagram from a given single line diagram of a power system network. 
#### The single line diagram includes synchronous generators, synchronous motors, transmission line, transformer and load. 
#### The per-unit reactance of each component has to be calculated depending on the base MVA, base kV [1]. 

#### The following approximations have been made while drawing the reactance diagram.
1. The neutral reactance is neglected.
2. Resistances are neglected.
3. Static loads are neglected.
4. Shunt branches of equivalent circuit of transformer are neglected.
5. The capacitance of the shunt transmission lines is also neglected.

#### The reactance diagram can be framed from single line diagram by the following procedures:
1. Selection of a base power kVAb or MVAb 
2. Selection of a base voltage kVb 
3. The base voltage kVb will be changed when there is a presence of transformer. 
                kVb on LT section = kVb on HT section x (LT voltage rating / HT voltage rating) 
	kVb on HT section = kVb on LT section x (HT voltage rating / LT voltage rating) 
4. When ohmic reactance of a component is given, the per unit reactance can be calculated as  
                 Per unit reactance = actual reactance / base reactance
