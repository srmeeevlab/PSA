#### The aim of the experiment is to frame the reactance diagram for a given power system network.   
#### At the end of the experiment the student will able to,
1. Draw the reactance diagram for a given Power System network.
2. Calculate the per unit values of all the components in a network on a common base.
3. Label the Per unit quantities of all components in reactance diagram.
