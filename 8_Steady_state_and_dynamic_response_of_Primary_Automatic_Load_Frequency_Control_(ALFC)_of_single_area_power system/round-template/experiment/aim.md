#### The aim of the experiment is to determine the stability analysis of primary Automatic Load Frequency Control (ALFC) of single area power system.
#### At the end of the experiment the student will able to,
1.	Model the block diagram of Automatic Load Frequency Control (ALFC).
2.	Calculate the steady state error of Terminal Voltage.
3.	Perform the steady state analysis of Primary ALFC of single area power system.
