#### The aim of the experiment focuses on modelling the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) and, to perform the steady state analysis and the dynamic analysis of AVR.
#### At the end of the experiment the student will able to,
1.	Model the block diagram of Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR).
2.	Calculate the steady state error of Terminal Voltage.
3.	Perform the eigen value analysis of Automatic Voltage Regulator.
