### INTRODUCTION<br>
#### The basic exciter in synchronous generator is called as Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR).It is used to maintain the terminal voltage of the Synchronous Generator (SG). Also it can be installed in various places of power system like transformer bus, feeders, etc. Whenever the reactive power demand increases at load side, the system voltage tends to fluctuate due to increasing in reactive power. The AVR decides the amount of the reactive power generated by the synchronous generator and it is delivered to the power system/load. Thus the variation of the terminal voltage at the synchronous generator can be controlled by AVR [4].

### CONCEPT<br>
#### The excitation system in SG uses an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) to maintain terminal voltage and regulate the reactive power. Hence, the power system stability is mainly depends on the AVR system. 
#### The role of an AVR is to maintain the rated terminal voltage of a SG and has four main components of amplifying model, exciting unit, generator field winding, and sensor. 
#### The transfer function of the four components is obtained from the mathematical modelling of their linearised equations. Thereby the non-linearity and saturations are ignored. 
#### This experiment mainly focuses on to know the modelling of AVR and its block diagram parameters. Also it is helpful to understand how the terminal voltage is maintained by AVR and know the error between the given reference voltage and actual terminal voltage at the bus.  In addition the Eigenvalues for the AVR is calculated and plotted to know about the stability of AVR model.
