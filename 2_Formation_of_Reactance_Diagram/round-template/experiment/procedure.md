##### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator


1. Formation of Reactance Diagram

    1. After going through the theory and pretest, click the "Simulation" tab.
    2. The user has to enter Base MVA, BaseKV, Z(old)per unit and Z(new)per unit. For G1 G2, M1, L1 and L2. And for transformers T1 and T2 we have primary side and secondary side for BaseKV. For the transmission line we don't have BaseKV. The user has to select the common base value for per unit calculation. If the user is not selecting the common base for per unit calcution then virtual lab platform will show an error message to select the base.
    3. Then the user has to click Verify Znew(p.u) button. The website will compare the calculated Z(new) vs the user entered Z(new).
    4. If Both the values are wrong then the site will display Wrong Answer.

    5. Once the user enter the right value the website will display the value entered by the user showing that the experiment is correct.

    6.  This same procedure is followed in question 2. User can go to question 2 by clicking Next question. User has to enter the values for the experiment.Then the user has to click Verify Znew(p.u) button.
