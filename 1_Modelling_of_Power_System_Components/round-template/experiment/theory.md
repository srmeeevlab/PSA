### INTRODUCTION<br>
#### Power system is an electrical network that consists of mainly three processes namely generation, transmission, distribution of electric power from utility to commercials[1].
#### To define the functioning of the power system, a modelling of these components is essential. Hence the per unit quantities are used for simplified modelling of the power system and for better understanding.
#### The per unit representation is preferred in power flow analysis, short circuit analysis and various other domains in Power systems. Some of the advantages in per unit system are:
1. The possibility of wrong selection between phase and line quantities in a three-phase system is highly reduced.
2. The impedance of equipment is specified in per unit values by the manufacturers.
3. Per-unit quantities are independent of voltage level and same on either side of a transformer.
4. The per-unit impedances of machines of same type and widely different rating usually lie within narrow range although the ohmic values differ much.
#### The per unit impedance is directly proportional to the base MVA and inversely proportional to square of base KV.

### CONCEPT<br>
#### Electric power system is the high voltage electrical grid, which consists of all electrical components[3]. Electric power system has mainly categorized into three divisions.

1. Generating station:
–	Electric energy is generated in large hydro-electric, thermal and nuclear stations etc. 
–	These generating stations are generally situated far away from the load centers. 
2. Transmission system: 
–	The transmission lines link between generating station and the distribution system that lead to other power system interconnections. 
–	Transmission line transmits bulk electrical power from the generating station to the receiving end stations. 
–	The transmission voltages are generally of 66 kV, 110 kV, 132 kV, 220 kV, 400 kV and 765 kV. 
–	For the better performance and efficiency of the system, high voltage transmission lines are preferred to transmit electrical power from the sending end substations to the receiving end substations. 
–	At the receiving end substations, the voltage is stepped down to a lower value of 66kV, 33kv or 11kV.
3. Distribution system:
–	The high voltages received from transmission system may further sub-divided at distribution system using a step-down transformer. These voltages are utilized for applications like home appliances, industries and academic institutions etc.

#### To define the functioning of the power system, a modelling of these components is essential. Hence the per unit quantities are used for simplified modelling of the power system and for better understanding.
